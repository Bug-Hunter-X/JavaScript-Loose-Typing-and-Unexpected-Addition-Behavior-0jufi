# JavaScript Loose Typing and Unexpected Addition Behavior

This example demonstrates how JavaScript's loose typing system can lead to unexpected results when using the + operator for addition.  The examples show different data types being added together, resulting in surprising behavior.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.js` shows one approach to mitigating the issue with input validation and type checking.

## How to run

1.  Save the code in `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js`
2.  Open your browser's developer console.
3.  Run the JavaScript files. Observe the output in the console.

This is a classic example of why robust input validation and type checking are crucial when working with JavaScript.
